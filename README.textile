h1. Bent Templates

Rails templates bent to your will.

We are writing this project specifically for the Rails Rumble. Afterward, we intend to use it on all future client projects. You should too!

h2. Goals

* opinionated templating
** if you want different behavior, fork us
** if you add opinionated behavior, send us a pull request
* allow a collection of sub-templates
* master template one-line declarations trigger sub-templates
